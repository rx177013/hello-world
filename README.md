Hey peeps,

I have a lot of people expecting great things from me and in all honesty I just wanna sleep and play video games. Then when I get bored of that, buy a couple of acres of land in the middle of nowhere and be bothered by noone and nothing. Maybe kinda like the amish - they don't care about what brand your clothes are or what Kanye is up to. They just live.
